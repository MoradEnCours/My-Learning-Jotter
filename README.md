# My Learning Jotter

This repository is where I document my learning journey for the different programming languages I intend to learn through tutorial guides, or already-known languages that I might like to revise or learn new concepts and styles of programming in. As a consequence, this repository does not concern itself with showing my own creative personally created works. 

Also, I have yet to fully establish a proper organisation to keep the work as visually simple to navigate through or clone. At the moment, clong individual folders rather than the entire repository is my initial recommendation.

But, for now, I consider having a single repository to record my tutorial-based learning to be better than multiple repositories in terms of accessibility: all material is nested and thus easily findable in a single location. Current mindset: Only make a new repository for a properly unique project.
