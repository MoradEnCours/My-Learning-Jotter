Currently, files are named: 1,2,3, though this has only been done since transferring the files has resulted in a 'name-is-too-long, change folder names error'.

Before experimenting with the code in the folders, make sure to rename the folders as follows:

1 ---> gumball
2 ---> gumballstate
3 ---> gumballstatewinner
